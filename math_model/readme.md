# Stochastic Model Simulation

This folder contains scripts capable of calculating the stochastic model distributions and simulating the effects of varying stochastic model design and platform parameters.

## Folder structure

This folder contains the following elements:
- *simulation_data/*: The resulting data when running the stochastic model simulation scripts.
- *an_simulator.py*: This module contains stochastic model simulation capabilities.
- *h_vs_res.py*: Generate entropy versus resolution data.
- *m5_sim.py*: Simulation of measurement m5.
- *math_model.py*: Pipelined TRNG stochastic model script.
